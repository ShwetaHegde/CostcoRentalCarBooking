# CostcoRentalCarBooking
This program is used to check Costco Rental Car prices. Once you book rental cars, sometimes prices go down.
This code takes the booked price from your account and checks the current price for the same and emails you if prices
have gone down.
You need to modify config_file to adjust to your account
